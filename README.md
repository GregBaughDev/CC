# [Coding Challenges from John Crickett](https://codingchallenges.substack.com/)

- 1 [Link](https://github.com/GregBaughDev/CC/tree/main/1) - Kotlin - Completed all steps apart from `cat'ing` text in to the file. I've compared the result of running this against `wc` and it returns the same results for all commands.
- 2 TODO: Will return to this one
- 3 [Link](https://github.com/GregBaughDev/CC/tree/main/3) - Java - Mostly completed. There's an odd bug with larger files which is causing characters to be dropped and I'm not sure why. I've spent a bunch of time debugging but without any luck. This could also do with a refactor and I know it's not very performant (nested loops!) but I learnt a heap about working with bits. The compression does work nicely though and it cuts the file size down to ~50%. A few other solutions I looked at didn't actually do the bitpacking so the file size remained the same as the non compressed file.
